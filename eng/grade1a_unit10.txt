number the pictures
one is a pencil
two is a duck
three is a little ear
four is a flag
five is a key
six is a whistle

count the number
one pencil
two ducks
three little ears
four flags
five keys
six whistles

You watch me play the hula hoop
He watches the bus stop
They watch us run on the sports field

come and play
link the numbers

What can you see？I see fun numbers. 
What do you eat？I eat fruit.
What did you buy？I bought some flowers.
What will you take？I will take my schoolbag.
