have a go
have a try

Let me try
ready to go
good job
You can do it

act out a story
take out your family photos

 fly away
run away
walk away
come back

a black bird flaps his wings
two black birds are sitting on a hill
a bird is sitting on my shoulder 
the bird is coming back

small and little
high and low

It’s time to fly
It’s time to eat
It’s time to sleep
It’s time for breakfast / lunch / dinner 
It’s time for bed
