animals in our lives

It is small
It is cute
It is cozy
It’s warm
It’s round
It’s soft
It’s helpful 

Hens lay eggs for us
Horses take us for rides
Bees make honey for us
Dogs stay with us and love us

design a pet house for animals
design a pet home for Goldie

She has a ball for Mira
I have a house for my cat
They have a pet home for animals

give your pet a name
give your cat some milk
give my dog some food
give me your answer
